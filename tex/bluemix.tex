    \caption{The CrossTREEs tools used in this research has already been deployed into
   a cloud-based programmer IDE. The circular display shows lines of ode in a software system
    and the red sections denote regions predicted to be buggy. The recommendations shown on the screen are CrossTREEs' advice
    for how a developer can reduce the expected number of bugs
    in their code. By our reckoning, screens like the above are seen
    by the developers of 1600 projects. Given all that expertise reflecting on our recommendations, the research challenge of this research it so find some way to combine all the insight into better and actionable models of
    software quality
