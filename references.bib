	abstract = {Transfer learning: is the process of translating quality predictors learned in one data set to another. Transfer learning has been the subject of much recent research. In practice, that research means changing models all the time as transfer learners continually exchange new models to the current project. This paper offers a very simple bellwether transfer learner. Given N data sets, we find which one produce the best predictions on all the others. This bellwether data set is then used for all subsequent predictions (or, until such time as its predictions start failing-- at which point it is wise to seek another bellwether). Bellwethers are interesting since they are very simple to find (just wrap a for-loop around standard data miners). Also, they simplify the task of making general policies in SE since as long as one bellwether remains useful, stable conclusions for N data sets can be achieved just by reasoning over that bellwether. From this, we conclude (1) this bellwether method is a useful (and very simple) transfer learning method; (2) bellwethers are a baseline method against which future transfer learners should be compared; (3) sometimes, when building increasingly complex automatic methods, researchers should pause and compare their supposedly more sophisticated method against simpler alternatives.},

abstract="This paper examines the theoretical and practical problems that arise from attempts to develop formal characterizations and explanations of many work activities, in particular, collaborative activities. We argue that even seemingly discrete individual activities occur in, and frequently draw upon a complex network of factors: individual, social and organizational. Similarly, organizational and social constraints and practices impact upon individual cognitive processes and the realization of these in specific tasks. Any adequate characterization of work activities therefore requires the analysis and synthesis of information from these traditionally separate sources. We argue that existing frameworks, emanating separately from the respective disciplines (cognitive, social and organizational) do not present an adequate means of studying the dynamics of collaborative activity in situ. An alternative framework, advocated in this paper, is distributed cognition. Its theoretical basis is outlined together with examples of applied studies of computer-mediated work activities in different organizational settings.",

pages="39--77",
abstract="This paper provides an analysis of the behavior of separate-and-conquer or covering rule learning algorithms by visualizing their evaluation metrics and their dynamics in coverage space, a variant of ROC space. Our results show that most commonly used metrics, including accuracy, weighted relative accuracy, entropy, and Gini index, are equivalent to one of two fundamental prototypes: precision, which tries to optimize the area under the ROC curve for unknown costs, and a cost-weighted difference between covered positive and negative examples, which tries to find the optimal point under known or assumed costs. We also show that a straightforward generalization of the m-estimate trades off these two prototypes. Furthermore, our results show that stopping and filtering criteria like CN2's significance test focus on identifying significant deviations from random classification, which does not necessarily avoid overfitting. We also identify a problem with Foil's MDL-based encoding length restriction, which proves to be largely equivalent to a variable threshold on the recall of the rule. In general, we interpret these results as evidence that, contrary to common conception, pre-pruning heuristics are not very well understood and deserve more investigation.",

pages="225--245",
abstract="In rule discovery systems, learning often proceeds by first assessing the quality of the system's current rules and then modifying rules based on that assessment. This paper addresses the credit assignment problem that arises when long sequences of rules fire between successive external rewards. The focus is on the kinds of rule assessment schemes which have been proposed for rule discovery systems that use genetic algorithms as the primary rule modification strategy. Two distinct approaches to rule learning with genetic algorithms have been previously reported, each approach offering a useful solution to a different level of the credit assignment problem. We describe a system, called RUDI, that exploits both approaches. We present analytic and experimental results that support the hypothesis that multiple levels of credit assignment can improve the performance of rule learning systems based on genetic algorithms.",

abstract="SBSE researchers often use an evolutionary algorithm to solve various software engineering problems. This paper explores an alternate approach of sampling. This approach is called SWAY (Samplying WAY) and finds the (near) optimal solutions to the problem by (i) creating a larger initial population and (ii) intelligently sampling the solution space to find the best subspace. Unlike evolutionary algorithms, SWAY does not use mutation or cross-over or multi-generational reasoning to find interesting subspaces but relies on the underlying dimensions of the solution space. Experiments with Software Engineering (SE) models shows that SWAY's performance improvement is competitive with standard MOEAs while, terminating over an order of magnitude faster.",

abstract = {Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely manual process. We introduce a fully automated method for locating and repairing bugs in software. The approach works on off-the-shelf legacy applications and does not require formal specifications, program annotations or special coding practices. Once a program fault is discovered, an extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program variants until one is found that both retains required functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode program requirements. After a successful repair has been discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging. We describe the proposed method and report experimental results demonstrating that it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling 63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.},

The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

 abstract = {Software systems are designed and engineered to process data. However, software is data too. The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

Much of this research has been focused on determining how to use various IR techniques to support concept location. Very little attention has been given to the effect of different configurations of corpus building and indexing on query results. In this paper, we propose a tool designed to support large-scale studies of IR techniques in varying configurations of parameters with the intention of automatically calibrating these parameters. We also discuss preliminary efforts to create the benchmark data such studies require.},

 address = {Kingston, ON},
 pages = {1-10},
 abstract = {One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is concept location in source code. In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.},

abstract = {Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Ma2012,
    abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built
    models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction
    models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these
    models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of
    the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has
    attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain
    using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when
    distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate
    for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we
    consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and
    target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross
    company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build
    faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior
    works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we
    proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the
    information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution
    estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company
    data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted
    data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents
    a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the
    experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It
    indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the
    receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the
    state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are
    too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful
    knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may
    help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide
    optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing
    cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process.

@article{vcboost16,
abstract = {It is well-known that software defect prediction is one of the
most important tasks for software quality improvement. The use of defect
predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby
testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance
costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there
should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model.
Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible
since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies.
Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the
difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of
imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the
performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning
can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric
misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from
distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the
appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics
test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical
significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results
show that our approach can provide higher prediction performance than both
the existing CPDP technique and the existing class imbalance technique.},

abstract="Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.",

abstract = "Context: Data miners have been widely used in software engineering to, say, generate defect predictors from static code measures. Such static code defect predictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use and useful to use. But one of the “black arts” of data mining is setting the tunings that control the miner. Objective: We seek simple, automatic, and very effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with different data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential evolution as an optimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required tens, not thousands, of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tunings that alter detection precision from 0\% to 60\%. Conclusion: Since (1) the improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change standard methods in software analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result without conducting a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue."
